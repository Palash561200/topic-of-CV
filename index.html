        <h3>Titration</h3>
        <p>A titration is a technique where a solution of known concentration is used to determine the concentration of
            unknown solution.</p>
        <ol class="order">
            <li>Typically,the titrant (the known sol)</li>
            <li>is added from buret</li>
            <li>to a known quantity</li>
            <li>of the analyte unknown solution</li>
            <li>until the reaction complete</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Colorimetric Assay</h3>
        <p>
            The principle of this method lies in the generation of color by chemical reaction btween target analyte and
            reagents. <br>The most significant advantage of the Colorimetric assay on paper is its simplicity.
        </p>

        <p>Ex. Its are often used for protein analysis.</p>

        <h3>Antibiogram</h3>
        <p>An Antibiogram is an overall profile of microbial susceptibility testing results of a specific micro-organism
            to a battery of antimicrobial drug.</p>
        <h4>Uses for</h4>
        <ol class="order">
            <li>help clinician and pharmacist in selecting best antimicrobial treatment.</li>
            <li>Useful tools for detecting and monitoring in antimicrobial resistantce.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Test done by</h3>
        <ol class="order">
            <li>Sample collect from patient</li>
            <li>sent in lab</li>
            <li>test, antibiotics of various levels of concentration.</li>
            To see how much of the drug is needed to kill the pathogen.

        <h3>Basic Immunochemistry</h3>
        <p>
            Immunochemistry is the study of the chemistry of immune system. This involves the study of the
            properties,function,interaction and production of the chemical components
            (antibodys/immunoglobulins,toxin,epitopes of protein like CD4,antitoxin,chytokines,antigen) of the immine
            system.
